Must do:

Implement file navigator
Implement `a` and `A` insertion
Implement `x` deletion
Implement `d` deletion
Implement `u` undo and `ctrl+r` redo

Can do this one whenever, 0 thought required
    - Switch to a more pastel color scheme

Add functionality to do an operation multiple times (like `75gg` or `3w`)
Implement `g` functionality (whatever it is)
Implement `VISUAL` mode
Implement a buffer for movement jumps (`w,e,g,etc`) (so you can reverse them)
Implement `ctrl+O` and `ctrl+I` movement
Implement a buffer for deletion (just store the last deletion)
Implement copy paste containers tied to each key (not in vim but would be super awesome)
Implement a buffer for cmd line commands
Implement more cmd line controls (look at vim docs for ideas)

Bugs:

None found


Wishlist (no particular order):
Fix up console output (for example `python3` console doesn't work properly at all)
    - Set up console input

Get a save file system going similar to swap
    - Compress it using huffman compression if space is available (can check using os)

Spellcheck
    - Factor oracle, suffix trie (two modes?)

Real time automatic testing
    - Given input to stream in, output to check against, try every couple seconds (if prog will compile) and if it matches notify user (maybe add regex for a little flex)

Inertial Scrolling

Implement night/day color schemes 
    - Need to refactor color scheming to make it easier in the future anyways
    - Maybe display `!` in all colors and let the user pick with some prompts?

Konami Code easter egg

Stuff to mention during 275 presentation:
    
    Used a linked list to represent all of the lines
	- makes insertion and deletion O(1) intead of O(n)
	    - talk about python list slices creating a new list, worse for memory too

    Talk about usage of abstraction to make implementing features and changing implementations of existing features relatively painless
	- learned about importance throughout project, came to appreciate it when I had to change line storage from list to linked list to make inserting and deleting lines very fast (was very easy refactor)

    Talk about `subprocess`, `subprocess.Popen`, etc
        - Bang! implementation; pipe handling

    Implemented Syntax Highlighting using `pygments`
        - Used a colors array for each line, kept control of it really similar to the text itself

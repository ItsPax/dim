Must do:

Switch list representation to linked list
Implement `x` deletion


Wishlist:
Get a save file system going similar to swap
Find a more efficient solution for `w` jumping, one right now is very costly, in this scenario efficiency > elegance
Divide and conquer approach for finding where to `w` and `b` jump
***Refactor word jumping (`w` and `b`) for more clean code (so shit rn)
***It's bugged too; just gonna leave it and implement divide and conquer solution a little later

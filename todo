Must do:

Implement enter and deal with backspace at beginning of line (line creation and deletion)
Implement status bar
Implement `x` deletion
Implement `d` deletion
Add functionality to do an operation multiple times (like `75gg` or `3w`)
Implement `g` functionality (whatever it is)
Implement `VISUAL` mode
Implement file navigator


Wishlist:
Get a save file system going similar to swap
Find a more efficient solution for `w` jumping, one right now is very costly, in this scenario efficiency > elegance
***Refactor word jumping (`w` and `b`) for more clean code (decent but could be better)

Stuff to mention during 275 presentation:
    
    Used a linked list to represent all of the lines
	- makes insertion and deletion O(1) intead of O(n)
	    - talk about python list slices creating a new list, worse for memory too

    Talk about usage of abstraction to make implementing features and changing implementations of existing features relatively painless
	- learned about importance throughout project, came to appreciate it when I had to change line storage from list to linked list to make inserting and deleting lines very fast
